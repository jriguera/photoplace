Description: A tool for geotagging your photos and ... much more!
 It is a multiplatform program to easily geotag your photos as well as
 generating a Google Earth/Maps layer with your photos and a track log
 from a GPS device. Moreover, the program can be easily adapted by editing
 templates and its functionality can be complemented with add-ons, for
 example there is one to generate a music tour that can be used to
 present your photo collection.
